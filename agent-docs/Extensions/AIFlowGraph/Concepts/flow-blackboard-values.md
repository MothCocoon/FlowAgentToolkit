# Flow Blackboard Values (Concept)

## What this is

The mechanism AIFlowGraph nodes use to **read and write entries on an actor's Behavior Tree
Blackboard** (`UBlackboardComponent`) from inside a Flow graph. A "blackboard value" is a small
inline-editable config object that names a target key and carries a typed value to set or compare
against it. This is the "blackboard-key" system in the AI Flow layer.

**This is strictly the Behavior Tree blackboard**, owned by the AIFlowGraph plugin. It is not a
general node-to-node data store; use Flow data pins to pass values between nodes.

## The pieces

- **`UFlowBlackboardEntryValue`** (`AIFLOW_API`, abstract, `EditInlineNew`, display name
  "Blackboard Value") - the config base. Its `Key` property (`FFlowBlackboardEntry`) selects which
  blackboard key this value targets.
- **Typed subclasses** - one per Behavior Tree key type: `Bool`, `Int`, `Float`, `Vector`,
  `Rotator`, `Name`, `String`, `Object`, `Class`, `Enum`. Each knows the `UBlackboardKeyType`
  subclass it is built for (`GetSupportedBlackboardKeyType`).

## What it does

- **Set** - `SetOnBlackboardComponent(BlackboardComponent)` writes this value onto the named key.
- **Compare** - `CompareKeyValues(BlackboardComponent, OtherKeyName)` compares this value to a key's
  current value. Numeric subclasses can also provide values for `EArithmeticCompare` through
  `TryGetNumericalValuesForArithmeticOperation`.
- **Drive from a Data Pin** - `TrySetValueFromInputDataPin(PinName, PinOwnerFlowNode)` lets the value
  come from an incoming Flow **data pin** at runtime instead of being authored inline, and the value
  can be surfaced back out as a data pin property.

## When to use / not use

- Use when an AIFlowGraph node needs to set or test an AI blackboard key as part of graph flow.
- Do **not** use this as a general node-to-node data store within a graph; use Flow data pins.
  The "blackboard" name is a common source of confusion because this is specifically the Behavior
  Tree blackboard.
